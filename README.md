## Problem statement

This project is geared towards young researchers such as undergraduates motivated to pursue graduate school. 
Undergraduate research experience is a major factor in graduate admissions. 
However, as a beginner, it is extremely challenging for an undergrad to identify the broad research topics and 
the fastest growing areas in any field he/she is interested in. Moreover, simply going through publication databases 
isn't a viable solution: every year thousands of papers are published in every research area in physics!

This project attempts to answer some of these problems. I have identified and compared the buzzwords of two different years 
which gives us an indication of the rising trends in physics. Using topic modelling, I have identified broad research topics 
as well as sub-topics contained in them. An interested reader can not only get a clear view of the research landscape in any 
broad are in physics but also find out some of the specific questions that belong to any field.
